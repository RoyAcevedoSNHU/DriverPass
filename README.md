1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
   The goal of the DriverPass project was to provide a comprehensive system for a customer who wished to expedite and simplify the driving education process. DriverPass, the customer, needed a system that would let users book driving lessons, access online resources, and monitor their progress. In order to manage instructors, cars, and appointments, they also required administrative tools. Additionally, they needed to integrate with other systems, like as the DMV, to receive updates on policies and regulations.
2. What did you do particularly well?
   I was quite good at simplifying intricate user interactions into understandable, well-structured diagrams. The driving lesson scheduling UML activity diagram was notable because it clearly illustrated the sequential procedure and made sure the system's operation was simple to comprehend. I also put a lot of effort into creating designs that are easy to use and added security features to safeguard private information like user accounts and payment details.
3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   The UML class diagram is the one aspect of my work that I would change if I could. Although it included all required classes and relationships, I would improve the visual representation of relationships—specifically, the usage of composition and multiplicity symbols—to make it more accurate and polished. It would be easier to read and guarantee that every system component is properly documented with clearer annotations and consistent style.
4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   I put the demands of the user first by concentrating on elements that were essential to the client's needs, such as lesson monitoring, appointment scheduling, and payment processing. These were put into practice using user-friendly procedures that let consumers check available timeslots and easily reschedule appointments. Because it guarantees that the system satisfies real-world expectations and provides a solution that is both practical and easy to use, taking user demands into account is essential.
5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
   When I build software, I split the system down into smaller, more manageable parts, examine user needs, and turn those needs into understandable representations. Regular feedback loops guarantee alignment with user expectations, while methods such as UML modeling aid in visualizing system interactions. I intend to use more agile approaches in the future, such iterative design and continuous testing, to improve designs and more successfully adjust to shifting requirements.
